\section{Version 2.0.0}{
    \itemize{
        \item API Changes:
        \itemize{
            \item deviceType, gpuInfo, cpuInfo not longer accepts 'platform_idx' parameter as OpenCL contexts cannot contain more than one platform.
        }
        \item New Features:
        \itemize{
            \item Added functionality to create custom OpenCL functions from user provided kernels
            \item Added `synchronize` function to assure completion of device calls (necessary for benchmarking)
            \item Added determinant function (det)
            \item Allow for gpuR object - base object interaction (e.g. vclMatrix * matrix)
            \item Added `inplace` function for 'inplace' operations.  These operations include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sin`, `asin`, `sinh`, `cos`, `acos`, `cosh`, `tan`, `atan`, `tanh`.
            \item Added `sqrt`, `sum`, `sign`,`pmin`, and `pmax` functions
            \item Methods to pass two gpuR matrix objects to `cov`
            \item Added `norm` method
            \item Added gpuRmatrix/gpuRvector Arith `+`,`-` methods
        }
        \item Bug Fixes:
        \itemize{
            \item Fixed incorrect device info when using different contexts
            \item Fixed Integer Matrix Multiplication
            \item All OpenCL devices will be initialized on startup (previous version occasionally would omit some devices)
        }
        \item Features in Progress:
        \itemize{
            \item Parallel GPU functionality
            \item Implementing 'complex' data type
