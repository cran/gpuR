\section{Version 2.0.2}{
    \itemize{
        \item API Changes:
        \itemize{
            \item The \code{solve} method for \code{gpuMatrix} objects now returns a \code{gpuMatrix} to remain consistent with the overall gpuR API \ghit{108}
            \item The default numeric type has been changed to 'float' to allow all devices to use the functions herein by default as is also generally faster than 'double' which is not always required. \ghit{92}
        }
        \item New Features:
        \itemize{
            \item Added matrix-vector product for \code{gpuMatrix}/\code{gpuVector} objects \ghit{98}
            \item The deprecation warnings often returned from \code{custom_opencl} are now suppressed to avoid end-user confusion \ghit{103}

            \item Improved error message when referring to queues \ghit{119}
            \item \code{custom_opencl} now allows for kernels to call internally defined functions \ghit{129}
            \item Added `inplace` operations for `exp`, `abs` \ghit{141}

            \item Allow for gpuR object - base object interaction (e.g. vclMatrix * matrix)
