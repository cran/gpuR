gpuR

========

This package is functional for all OS systems (to my knowledge).
If installation fails, after consulting the wiki mentioned below,
please feel free to submit an issue on the project github
(https://github.com/cdeterman/gpuR/issues)

In order for it to work you will need some form of OpenCL installed
on your machine.  Windows systems often have a simple Intel OpenCL
installed by default and OSX have OpenCL installed by default
for their graphics processors.  For most Linux systems, you
will likely need to install either a vendor specific SDK
or look in to installing a non-vendor specification implementation
like 'pocl'. Follow your vendor specific instructions to install.

The installation of this package is OS specific.  For detailed
instructions please see my github wiki (https://github.com/cdeterman/gpuR/wiki).
