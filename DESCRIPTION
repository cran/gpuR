Title: GPU Functions for R Objects
Description: Provides GPU enabled functions for 'R' objects in a simple and
    approachable manner.  New 'gpu*' and 'vcl*' classes have been provided to
    wrap typical 'R' objects (e.g. vector, matrix), in both host and device
    spaces, to mirror typical 'R' syntax without the need to know 'OpenCL'.
