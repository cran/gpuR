\title{vclMatrix Class}
\description{
This is the 'mother' class for all
vclMatrix objects.  These objects are pointers
to viennacl matrices directly on the GPU.  This will
avoid the overhead of passing data back and forth
between the host and device.

As such, any changes made
to normal R 'copies' (e.g. A <- B) will be propogated to
the parent object.

There are multiple child classes that correspond
to the particular data type contained.  These include
\code{ivclMatrix}, \code{fvclMatrix}, and
\code{dvclMatrix} corresponding to integer, float, and
double data types respectively.
}
\note{
R does not contain a native float type.  As such,
the matrix data within a \code{\link{fvclMatrix-class}}
will be represented as double but downcast when any
vclMatrix methods are used.

May also remove the type slot
