\title{gpuMatrix Class}
\description{
This is the 'mother' class for all
gpuMatrix objects.  It is essentially a wrapper for
a basic R matrix (possibly to be improved).  All other
gpuMatrix classes inherit from this class but
there are no current circumstances where this class
is used directly.

There are multiple child classes that correspond
to the particular data type contained.  These include
\code{igpuMatrix}, \code{fgpuMatrix}, and
\code{dgpuMatrix} corresponding to integer, float, and
double data types respectively.
}
\note{
R does not contain a native float type.  As such,
the matrix data within a \code{\link{fgpuMatrix-class}}
will be represented as double but downcast when any
gpuMatrix methods are used.

May also remove the type slot
